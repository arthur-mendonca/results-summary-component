## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The main challenge was adjusting the two boxes (result and summary boxes) in a way they fit perfectly each other, both in desktop and mobile display.

I've chosen "position: relative" and flex-box to achieve this goal.
